        <p>Hi My name is Ve, welcome to my portfolio website. I am a student of The Hague University of Applied Science. </p>
        <p>I am an upcoming User Experience Designer. On this website, you will find any professional information about me regarding myself and what I have done during this course.</p>

<div class="aboutMe">
    <h2>A Good Boy!</h2>
    <p>I would regard myself as a good boy. A good boy who tries to make everyone happy. Since the day I was born until now, I would say I am good at following instructions. When somebody tells me to do something, they always smile and are happy because I execute the instructions as they wish. I always try to put myself in someone’s shoes, observe and  try to dig deeper into something that they do not notice on the instructions. This will help me when executing the instruction, it will have more meaning or an impact for the user. This also shows how much effort you put on putting yourself in someone’s shoes.</p>
    <p>I guess life teaches me to always follow the instructions, but there would be another time when I do not want to follow the instructions but I need to. I need to because I am a good boy. For example, when I was younger in my nuclear family. I took my bachelor in Economics as wished by my parents. I know the reason why they did that because they want to give me a prospect in life and they think persuading a career in art would not give me a decent life. At that time, I was very sad and considered not going to university. Then later on, I tried to be open-minded and to make my parents happy, but I also proposed my wish that after I finished my study in economics I will persuade my career in art. They accepted. This was where I sharpened my bargaining skills so our needs would be fulfilled. This kind of situation always happens when you work together with your team, or even making a product for your client.</p>
    <p>Continuing my story of my first university, working intensively at my economics major maybe could enrich my knowledge and make me see art in a different way. Well, it was true, I finished my study in 3.5 years of 4 years study and with good results, 3.60 out of 4. Learning economics was not a bad choice for me, even though much of the insights could also be gained just by our usual daily life. My parents were very happy and they even supported me afterwards and helped me when I wanted to study design. If I had not studied economics as my parents wished, I would not know if my parents would support me in persuading my design career.  This was my big lesson. If we do something that a person wants, sometimes they can repay it much more than we did.</p>
    <p>As a user experience designer or a designer in general, we want to create or sell products for the consumer. If we do not design a product based on what consumers needs, wants or is capable off, how can our products be bought by them?</p>
    <p>To summarise, becoming an UX Designer, the important skill that we need to have is placing ourselves in someone’s situation. Becoming a good boy not only about following exactly what our parent or user’s wants, but how creative we are in fulling your user’s needs and ours, because becoming a good boy is not only about other people but also about ourselves. As a designer, for me, giving my designs my own touch is very important, that makes the product unique.</p>
