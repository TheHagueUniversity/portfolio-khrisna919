        <h2 class="gold">Usabaility Testing: The Rijksmuseum Website</h2>
        <p>My friends and I, we tried to find a usability problem of the Rijksmuseum website. For this project, some
            part we did it together and some part we had to do it individually. This was my first time doing usability
            testing where we had to observe our user while using the Rijksmuseum website. We also conducted an interview
            and survey to get more insight of what kind of problems that our user struggling with. After we collected
            all the data from our user individually, then we combined our data to get a bigger picture of what kind of
            common problems and specific problems that our user facing.</p>

        <p>Before we jumped to the trials, we used the Rijksmuseum first to find initial problems or our assumption
            of which part of the Rijksmuseum website was having major problems. During the process, we found three
            major problems that we wanted to research. Which were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What kind of usability problems were users of different age facing while making a poster one of the
                paintings in the Rijksmuseum website?</li>
            <li>What kind of usability problems were users of different age facing while liking an artwork in the
                Rijksmuseum website?</li>
            <li>What kind of usability problems were users of different age facing while making his/her own collection?</li>
        </ol>

        <img src="images/result.jpg" alt="table of data" height="600px" width="1000px">
    </div>
    <div class="even">
        <p>But after we conducted the user trialing and combined our result, we found more problem regarding our main
            tasks or research question that made the participants struggling to solve the main tasks.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        ~~~
    </div>
    <div class="even">
        <p>For the Solution or recommendation, we used the data from our interview and surveys and also our knowledge
            of User Experience Design to make the recommendation more clear and concise. The recommendation that we
            would suggest were: 1) The main feature in this case was “Create your own Rijkstudio” should appear
            visibly in the screen of the user. 2) Give more explanation of what is “create your own Rijkstudio” 3)
            Also to see the map, I guess it would be handy that the user also can see it from their website.</p>

    <div>

    </div>
    <div class="even">
        <p>The project that involved another person with a different background always amazes me. My participant was a
            very complete stranger, and I was already afraid that my participant would not be cooperative since his
            age was double my age and my friends told me that he looked a bit scary. However, it ended up very well,
            he was not as scary as we thought and I also tried to be cooperative and gave clear instructions and tried
            to melt the ice in the situation so he would feel relaxed and he would speak out his mind about the problem that
            he was facing while using the website.</p>
