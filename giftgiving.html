        <h2 class="gold">Gift Giving Experience</h2>
        <p>On this project, we together designer our products for our users. For the user, we have a different user and then later on, we combine it, then it will become a persona. Besides our user, we also did it for a client, Hallmark. This is my first project that involved a real company. For this project we supposed to learn the whole process of Design Thinking such as: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. This my first time to applied the Design Thinking process. During this whole process we learn to always try and try and keep trying.</p>

        <p>The first activity that we need to do was empathize. On this stage, we did a lot of research to get to know the user concerning gift-giving experience. We conducted 3 different methods of research to get a clear and strengthen description of our user, i.e. Desk Research, ethnographic interview and Observation. (On the picture above, was my user. I was observing how she would react on receiving a gift.) It was very nice and memorable experience for me to get to know the user and observe them. My user was very funny and cooperative, she even asked me how I was doing before the project was finished.</p>

        <img src="images/persona.jpg" alt="a boy" height="700px">

    <div class="even">
        <p>Then we did the define process. We made a persona and design vision of gift-giving experience. The persona we did, it was kind of a story because we needed to present it to our lecture. The reason we did a story because we want our lecture to get to our user’s shoes so they know why we design this product.</p>
        <p>The design vision help us to guide our products to our user’s need that also establish in the persona.</p>

        <p>Ideation. This is a third phase where we squeezing our brain so much. Before I started to sketch, I need to determine the How Might We question. This HMW question is a tool to generate more ideas that is related to the user needs. I was struggling, but at least I could do lot of sketches, almost thirty sketches. I guess almost everyone (my classmate) was struggling to get exact 30 sketches of ideas.  Then we needed to select 3 best ideas. I used evaluation matrix technique to select those ideas based on the criteria that I choosed. On this stage, there was lot of sweat and tears, sacrifice and struggles. I guess this is the stage that determine how much dedication you lavished. </p>

        <img src="images/prototype.jpg" alt="a boy" height="700px">
    </div>
    <div class="even">
        <p>Then we did a prototype and test. We did a paper and digital prototype. This stage, we were testing our product if our product really represented and fulfilled the user need. On this stage, we did lot of iteration. We tried to get more feedback of our fellow students, lecturers and also our client hallmark. The feedback was very important, this was where we sometime did not see what people see. So here our final product.</p>

        <p> <b>The outcome:</b> <em>Above, from the left; Personalization Tool, Game, and Physical Card.</em> Those were our product combine. For this project, the best one will get selected and choosed by our client, which was Hallmark. Unfortunately, we did not get chosen, but it was very tough experience. Me and my friend, we helped and supported each other so we can pass this course. We also did lot of arguments because we wanted to fulfil our user since our user was different, but hey, this was where our ability to comprise got tested. We came up with an amazing persona, a persona that compliment our user together.</p>
