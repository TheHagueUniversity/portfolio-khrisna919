        <h2 class="gold">Gift Giving Experience</h2>
        <p>On this project, we designed our products together for our users. We  have a different user for each researcher initially and then later on, we combine them, then they will become a persona. Besides our users research, we also worked toegether with our client, Hallmark. This is my first project that involved a real company. For this project we were supposed to learn the whole process of Design Thinking such as: empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. This my first time to apply the Design Thinking process. During this whole process we learned to always try and try and keep trying.</p>

        <p>The first activity that we needed to do was empathizing. In this stage, we did a lot of research to get to
            know the user concerning his gift-giving experience. We conducted 3 different methods of research to get a
            clear and strong description of our user, i.e. Desk Research, ethnographic interview and observation.
            (On the picture above you can see my user. I was observing how she would react to receiving a gift.) It was a very
            nice and memorable experience for me to get to know the user and observe them. My user was very funny and
            cooperative, she even asked me how I was doing before the project was finished.</p>

        <img src="images/persona.jpg" alt="a boy" height="700px">
    </div>
    <div class="even">
        <p>Then we did the define process. We made a persona and design vision of a gift-giving experience. The persona
            that we made was kind of a story because we needed to present it to our lecturer. The reason we did a story
            was that we wanted our lecture to get know to our user’s shoes so he knows why we design this product.</p>
        <p>The design vision helped us to guide our products to our user’s need that is also established in the persona.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="images/ideation.jpg" alt="a boy" height="700px">

    <div class="even">
        <p>Ideation. This is a third phase where we were squeezing our brain so much. Before I started to sketch, I needed to
            determine the How Might We question. This HMW question is a tool to generate more ideas that are related to
            the user's needs. I was struggling, but at least I could do lot of sketches, almost thirty sketches. I guess
            almost everyone (my classmate) was struggling to get exact 30 sketches of ideas.  Then we needed to select
            3 best ideas. I used the evaluation matrix technique to select those ideas based on the criteria that I chose.
            In this stage, there were a lot of sweat and tears, sacrifices and struggles. I guess this is the stage that
            determines how much dedication you lavished. </p>

    <div>
        <img src="images/prototype.jpg" alt="a boy" height="700px">
    </div>
    <div class="even">
        <p>Then we did a prototype and test. We did a paper and digital prototype. In this stage, we were testing our
            product whether it really represented and fulfilled the user's need. In this stage, we did lot of iteration.
            We tried to get more feedback from our fellow students, lecturers and also our client Hallmark. The feedback
            was very important, this was where we sometimes did not see what people see. So here is our final product!</p>

    <div class="even">
        <p> <b>The outcome:</b> <em>Above, from the left; Personalization Tool, Game, and Physical Card.</em> Those
            are our products combined. For this project, the best one would get selected and chosen by our client,
             Hallmark. Unfortunately, we did not get chosen, but it was a very tough experience. Me and my
            friend, we helped and supported each other so we can pass this course. We also had a lot of arguments because
            we wanted to fulfil our user's needs which were a bit diverse, but hey, this was where our ability to compromise
            got tested. We came up with an amazing persona, a persona that combines our users together.</p>
