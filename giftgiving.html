        <h2 class="gold">Gift Giving Experience</h2>
        <p>On this project, we together designer our products for our users. For the user, we have a different user and then later on, we combine it, then it will become a persona. Besides our user, we also did it for a client, Hallmark. This is my first project that involved a real company. For this project we supposed to learn the whole process of Design Thinking such as: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. This my first time to applied the Design Thinking process. During this whole process we learn to always try and try and keep trying.</p>
