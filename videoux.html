        <h2 class="gold">A Product Review Video</h2>
        <p>I made a video of my product that I choosed, it was Gojek. Gojek was an application that is same like Uber and Grab, the differences this app from other sibling is, Gojek has lot of features. The goal of this assignment was to measure how well-understand students, which is me about the User Experience, and present arguments for what one consider good and bad UX design.</p>

        <p>Above was me trying to evaluate of my products whether it was a bad or good UX Design. Below also the picture of my poster that I did on Microsoft Word, the poster was the conclusion of the whole video.</p>

        <p>This was my first time that I recorded myself and I publish it on youtube. I went out from my comfort zone. I never have an courage to talk in front of camera. Honestly, it was bizarre for me and I even felt that I could not do it and try to talk to my lecture to find another way. Well, since I am from abroad and want to finish my study here, with my strong will I just did that. I got 9 out of 10. It was very very relief and very unexpected.</p>
