        <h2 class="gold">A Product Review Video</h2>
        <p>I made a video of my product that I chose, it was Gojek. Gojek is an application that is similar like Uber
            and Grab, the differences with this app from other siblings is that Gojek has lot of features. The goal of this
            assignment was to measure how well I understand the apps user experience, and present
            arguments for what we consider good and bad UX design.</p>

        <p>Above is me trying to evaluate my product whether it is a bad or good UX Design. Below shows a
            picture of my poster that I did in Microsoft Word, the poster was the conclusion of the whole video.</p>

        <p>This was my first time that I recorded myself and I published it on youtube. I went out of my comfort zone.
            I never had a courage to talk in front of a camera. Honestly, it was bizarre for me and I even felt that
            I could not do it and tried to talk to my lecture to find another way. Well, since I am from abroad and want
            to finish my study here, with my strong will I just did that. I got 9 out of 10. It was very very relief
            and very unexpected.</p>
